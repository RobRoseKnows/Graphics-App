# Graphics-App
This is a combinations of the various programs I developed in my high school Java graphics class. Unfortunately it is not a complete repository of my accomplishments in the class as I forgot to retreive many of my programs before I graduated. It has the following functions:

- Motion Blur
- Bokeh (Around a selected area)
- Tiltshift
- Possibly more
